**Rupert Sutherland, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand**  

Python functions for sedimentary basin analysis. This is a small collection of functions for analysis of sediment compaction, decompaction, and tectonic subsidence.

## Example 1. Mass Accumulation Rates, Tasman Sea
A supplement of code and data to accompany Sutherland et al. (2021): Neogene mass accumulation rate of carbonate sediment, Tasman Sea, southwest Pacific; Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology (AGU journal). The example includes additional functions for reading and depth-conversion of seismic reflection interpretations.
